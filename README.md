Predicting the future price of Bitcoin using historical price and sentiment data. By using data on the USD/BTC price from Yahoo Finance, along with data from Wikipedia about edits to the Bitcoin page.  

I will then merge and combine this data, then use it to train a random forest model that will tell us if Bitcoin prices will increase or decrease tomorrow. I will then switch to an XGBoost model and better predictors to improve accuracy.

I will develop a backtesting system and use a robust error metric so we can tell if the algorithm is performing well.  This system will also be able to make next-day predictions.
